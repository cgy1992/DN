Distributed Ninja
=======

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zhchbin/DN.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zhchbin/DN)

[Ninja][ninja] is a small build system with a focus on speed, it is born from @martine's work on the `Chromium` browser project. And DN, which is short for __Distributed Ninja__, can finish the time consuming compilation job with several machines.

*NOTE: currently this project is only a proof of concept. It just work, but performance didn't tested yet.*
